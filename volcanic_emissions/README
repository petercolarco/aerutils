# Preparing Simon Carn's volcanic database for GEOS
Convert Simon Carn's volcanic databases (both degassing + explosive) for use
in GEOS. There are two python scripts, one creates a separate set of files for
degassing and explosive while the other creates a combined set of files.

## Changelog

2024-08-14 Parker Case
No longer Python 2.7
All python has been made to work with python 3.x

REQUIRES PYTHON 2.7!
module load python/GEOSpyD/Ana2019.10_py2.7
practically speaking it is only *TOGETHER.py that needs to be run

Notes below ---- are from ../volcano11 and earlier
Updated explosive emissions in provided text file:
MSVOLSO2L4_20230621.txt
differs from volcano11 with change of one eruption in 2020 and
one in 2022, then added eruptions in 2023


01/06/2022
Updated explosive emissions in provided text file:
MSVOLSO2L4_20220105.txt
differs from previous with addition of two smaller eruptions
one in 2009 and one in 2015 and then later eruptions post

Notes below ---- are from ../volcano8
Updated passive degassing set from second page of OMI*.xls and stored
locally in so2_passive_degassing_2005-2019_20210715.txt
This inventory is valid 2005 - 2019, so modify python code to cope
with that. And have updated explosive emissions in provided text
file MSVOLSO2L4_20210621.txt

copied this from Valentina:
/archive/u/vaquila/volcanic_databases/volcanic_datasets_carn_20180523.tar

also find here toms_omi_inventory.20180523.txt, which is explosive database
she requests directly from Simon Carn

also find here Sci._Rep._2017_Carn.xls, which is the degassing dataset she got
directly from Simon Carn

I exported the first sheet of the XLS file as a tab delimited text file that
might even work with the python scripts




NOTES:
These python codes require modules not standard. Must load, e.g., by
setting up GEOS/GAAS environment. Must also create sub-directories
savepathExplosive
savepathDegassing
and then run:
python convert_carn2geos5_degassing_explosive.py

and then the one you really want is
mkdir volcanic_CARN_1978-2020_v202005
python convert_carn2geos5_degassing_explosive_TOGETHER.py
