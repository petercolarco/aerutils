The purpose of the code in the "aeronet" directory is to compare model
output to AERONET data and to analyze AERONET data.

There are a number of things you might want to do:
1) Create AERONET data
From the AERONET website you can download the entire dataset as either
monthly average, daily average, or all-points files.
- goto http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov
- on the left under "AERONET DATA ACCESS" see the block
  "AERONET OPTICAL DEPTH" and click on "Download All Sites"
- Get the files in the panel in the middle now:
  AOT_Level2_All_Points.tar.gz
  AOT_Level2_Daily.tar.gz
  AOT_Level2_Monthly.tar.gz
  These files are updated with some frequency as new data becomes available
- Put these files somewhere and unpackage them (tar -xvzf ...)
  I put them in, e.g., bender:/misc/prc10/AERONET/AOT
  When they are unpacked they create a sub-directory AOT under that level
  with LEV20/DAILY, LEV20/MONTHLY, LEV20/ALL_POINTS levels below which
  contain the unpacked dataset as a series of text files, one for each site
- In the aerutils/setup.csh file set the environment variable $AERONETDIR
  In this example, mine looks like:
   "setenv AERONETDIR /misc/prc10/AERONET/"
- Rather than deal with the text files all the time, I wrote code to turn
  the dataset into NETCDF files containing all data in a single file 
  (for the DAILY or MONTHLY files) or a series of NETCDF files (1 per site) 
  for the ALL_POINTS data.  You can do this:
   idl> .r aeronet_monthly2nc.pro
   idl> .r aeronet_daily2nc.pro
   idl> .r aeronet_allpts2nc.pro
  The output is places in ./output/aeronet2nc
  Note that only a temporal subset of the data is assembled in these files.

2) Assuming you have already done #1 and have the model sampled at the
AERONET points you can make a self-consistent monthly mean and histogram
dataset by running:
   idl> .r mon_mean.pro
   idl> .r histogram.pro
The output generated appears in ./output/mon_mean and ./output/histogram
Note: As these are setup, the AERONET "hourly" fields are read, which is
the allpts data as generated (binned into 6-hour time chunks).  So the
monthly means from these are the model sampled only at 6 hour time chunks
with valid AERONET measurements and weighted by the number of AERONET
measurements in that time.


3) Assuming you have already done #2 you can make various plots of the
the monthly mean datasets prepared.

   idl> .r scatter_ann.pro (or scatter_ann.color.pro)
        For a given year (or series of years) scatter the seasonal average
        of all sites model vs. AERONET AOT and Angstrom parameter

   idl> .r scatter_mon_mean.pro
        For a given year scatter the monthly mean of all sites model vs.
        AERONET for each month.  Actually three sets of plots:
        o greyscale
        o color-coded by domonant model aerosol species
        o color-coded by AERONET Angstrom exponent
        Plots for all sites included in mon_mean.pro construction.

   idl> .r scatter_mon_mean.multiyear.pro
        As for scatter_mon_mean.pro but assemble multiple years into a
        single plot

   idl> .r aeronet_site_monmean.pro
        For a given experiment, specify the years to assemble, make a
        series of plots, one for each site, of monthly mean AOT/Angstrom
        and scatter and PDF statistics plots
